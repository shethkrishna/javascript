    <!-- Question 3-->
    <h2> Q3. What is negative Infinity? </h2>
    <h2> Ans. </h2>
    <p>  NEGATIVE_INFINITY value behaves slightly differently than mathematical infinity: Any positive value, including POSITIVE_INFINITY , multiplied by NEGATIVE_INFINITY is NEGATIVE_INFINITY . Any negative value, including NEGATIVE_INFINITY , multiplied by NEGATIVE_INFINITY is POSITIVE_INFINITY . <br>
        The value Infinity (positive infinity) is greater than any other number.<br>
        The value Negative  Infinity (negative infinity) is less than any other number.</p>

    <!-- Question 4 -->

    <!-- Questio  5 -->
    <h2> Q5. What are undeclared and undefined variables? </h2>
    <h2> Ans. </h2>
    <p>Undeclared variables are those that have not been declared or defined in the current scope, while undefined variables are those that have been declared but not given a value.</p>

    <!-- Question 6 -->
    <h2> Q6. Write the code for adding new elements dynamically? </h2>
    <h2> Ans. </h2>
    <p> <b> 1.</b> var a = document.createElement("h2");
        a.textContent("hello this is new elememt")<br> 
        we can also use 'innerHTML' and 'innertext' instead of textContent.<br>
        <b> 2. </b> var a = document.setAttribute("class","list"); <br>This will create new attribute with classname 'list'. We can also ad 'id' attribute like this.
    </p>

    <h2> Q7. What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState? </h2>
    <h2> Ans. </h2>
    <table border="1" width="500px" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
        <tr>
            <th> Viewstate </th>
            <th> Sessionstate </th>

        <tr>
            <td> View state can only be visible from a single page and not multiple pages. </td>
            <td> Session state value availability is across all pages available in a user session.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> It will retain values in the event of a postback operation occurring. </td>
            <td> In session state, user data remains in the server. Data is available to user until the browser is closed or there is session expiration. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> Information is stored on the client’s end only. </td>

    <h2> Q8. What is === operator?</h2>
    <h2> Ans. </h2>
    <p> === operator is used for checking the value and the data type both are same or not.</p>

    <!-- Question 9 -->
    <h2> Q9. How can the style/class of an element be changed? </h2>
    <h2> Ans. </h2>
    <p> We can change, add or remove any CSS property from an HTML element on the occurrence of any event with the help of JavaScript.</p>
    <p> There are two common approaches that allow us to achieve this task. </p>
    <ul> 
        <li> style.property </li>
        <li> Changing the class itself </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li> <b> style.property :- </b>
            document.getElementById("id").style.property = new_style </li>
            <li> <b> Changing the class itself :-  </b>  document.getElementById("id").classList <br>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li> The add() method: It adds one or more classes. </li>
                <li> The remove() method: It removes one or more classes. </li>
                <li> The toggle() method: If the class does not exist it adds it and returns true. It removes the class and returns false. The second boolean argument forces the class to be added or removed.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
    </ol>

    <!-- Question 10 -->
    <h2> Q10. How to read and write a file using JavaScript?</h2>
    <h2> Ans. </h2>
    <ol>
       <li>
        file=fopen(getScriptPath(),0); The function fread() is used for reading the file content.
       </li>
       <li> str = fread(file,flength(file) ; The function fwrite() is used to write the contents to the file. </li>
       <li> file = fopen("c:\MyFile.txt", 3);// opens the file for writing.</li>

    </ol>

    <!-- Question 11 -->
    <h2> Q11. What are all the looping structures in JavaScript? </h2>
    <h2> Ans. </h2>
    <p> Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value. <br>
      Types of loops: 
      <ol>
        <li>
           <b> For loop: <br> Syntax:-</b> <br> for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement){}
        </li>
        <li> <b>While loop:  <br> Syntax :- </b><br> initialization <br>
        while(condition){
            <br> statement <br> increment/decrement
        }
        </li>
        <li> 
            <b> do while loop <br> Syntax:-</b> <br>
            initialization <br> 
            do{
                <br>statement <br>  increment/decrement
            } while(condition)
        </li>
      </ol>
      
    
    
    </p>


    <!-- Question 12 -->
    <h2> Q12. How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript? </h2>
    <h2> Ans. </h2>
    <p>There's a function called parseInt() in JavaScript, this is used for parsing a string as an argument and it returns an integer of the specified radix (basically the base of the numerical system) as output.</p>

    <!-- Question 13-->
    <h2> Q13.  What is the function of the delete operator? </h2>
    <h2> Ans. </h2>
    <p>The delete operator removes a property from an object. If the property's value is an object and there are no more references to the object, the object held by that property is eventually released automatically.</p>

    <!-- Question 14-->
    <h2> Q14. What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript? </h2>
    <h2> Ans. </h2>
    <p> There are 3 types of pop up boxes:

    <!-- Question 15-->
    <h2> Q15. What is the use of Void (0)? </h2>
    <h2> Ans. </h2>
    <p>JavaScript void 0 means returning undefined (void) as a primitive value. You might come across the term “JavaScript:void(0)” while going through HTML documents. It is used to prevent any side effects caused while inserting an expression in a web page.</p>

    <!-- Question 16 -->
    <h2> Q16. How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript? </h2>
    <h2> Ans. </h2>
    <p>we can use window. location object to force a page to load another page. We can use the location object to set the URL of a new page. <br>
        There are different ways – window.location.href property, window.location.assign() and window.location.replace() methods, to set the URL of a new page using the location object.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b> window.location.href: </b> This property contains information about the current URL of the page, and it can be used to redirect the user to a new page.</li>
            <li><b>window.location.replace: </b>  This method helps in replacing the current page in the browser's history with another page, but here the user will not be able to return back to the original page.</li>
            <li><b>window.location.assign: </b>This method which is used to add a new page to the browser's history allowing the users to return back to the original page browsed by the user.


            </li>
        </ol>

    <!-- Question 17 -->
    <h2>Q17. What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript? </h2>
    <h2> Ans. </h2>
    <p>Inner HTML is slow
        It is very slow because as inner HTML already parses the content even we have to parse the content again so that's why it takes time. When we have used the event handlers then the event handlers are not automatically attached to the new elements created by innerHTML.</p>
